# wake
A small program which takes multiple hostnames and figures out it's ip address
and macs by looking at `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/macs` respectivly. Don't have a
`/etc/macs`? Start writing one. Same syntax as `/etc/hosts`.

## Credit 
Forked from [pywakeonlan](https://github.com/remcohaszing/pywakeonlan) without the history as it was already halfwritten when I started looking at magical packets implementation in python. A pervious (lost) version of this program called pywakeonlan.
